     		ANYWAYS,
     		<ul>here's what you can do
     			<li>do something you love but may have held off because of being busy</li>
     			<li>eat somethong delicious</li>
     			<li>speak to peopke you cherish</li>
     			<li>just talk to yourself for a while and undersatnd yourself for you are the one who knows yourself the best and you should know better than anyone why you dont deserve to be sad because you're a precious person whose seen yourself go throught it all, small problems are not the same as invalid problems. Everyone has different problems depending on the life they're living and if this problem is silly compared to your friend's or even your past self's so be it. It doesnt make your problem invalid in any way.</li>
     			<li>watch or read soemthing funny, this is extremely effective too if its just a random mood off
     			</li></ul><br>
